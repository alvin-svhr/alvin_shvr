# GAME_2048_PHYTHON
This is a terminal-based implementation of the classic 2048 game, built using pure Python by Alviadi Fauzan (X3), Hiu Ben Yosia (X1), & Kay Matthew Maryanto (X1)
# 2048 Python Game (Terminal Version)
The game runs directly inside the terminal and is controlled using the arrow keys, providing a clean and simple console UI without external libraries like Pygame.

How to Play
The game starts with two tiles (2 or 4) placed randomly on the board.
Use the arrow keys to move tiles:

Left Arrow → move left

Right Arrow → move right

Up Arrow → move up

Down Arrow → move down

When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one.
After every valid move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears.
Press Q to quit the game at any time.
The game ends when no more moves are possible.

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.

2. Save the code in a file.

3. pen a terminal in the file’s directory.

4. Run the game

5. Enjoy playing 2048 in your terminal!
